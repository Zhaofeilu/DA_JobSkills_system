**Project overview**

The purpose of this project is to develop an interactive scoring system using MySQL as the database. The system helps users assess how well their skills match a particular job. Users can enter their skills or location, and the system calculates their skill compatibility based on predefined data and algorithms. In addition, the system will also recommend relevant skills to help users understand the areas that need to improve. The program helps users better understand their match with their target job, identify skills gaps, and get targeted skills improvement advice to improve their job search success.
Function overview

**Function overview**

-Users can query the job list through SQL and select the relevant job.
-After a user enters a skill, the system assesses the compatibility of their skill with the selected position through a stored procedure.
-Based on the skills entered by the user and the selected position, additional skills are recommended to help the user understand the areas for improvement.
-After the system calculates compatibility, the selected position, compatibility rating and recommended skills are displayed.
-User can view the results through SQL queries.

Through the program, users will be able to better understand the match of their skills to the position, receive targeted career advice, and thus improve their skill. The core functions of the system include skill compatibility evaluation and related skill recommendation.
